# Getting Started Weather App

This is a React.js based weather application.It displays live date,time and weather details such as temperature, wind speed, sunset etc based on the live location of the user(if allowed access) or the city entered by the user. In addition it can also display weather in both units celcius and farenhit. It also displays the weather forecast for next 5 hours and next five days.Based on the temperature, the background of the application also changes

Displays Delhi's weather as the default,also while chosing from the autocomplete list after chosing it we have to click on the search icon to extract the weather details.

Openweathermap API is used to extract all the weather details and also to provide an array of cities to implement autocomplete feature for the city name after typing atleast 3 characters

Uses tailwind css for the custom styles 

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
